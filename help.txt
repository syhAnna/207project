=============================== Note ========================================
We had a typo before, and we found it after the deadline.
We have emailed Professor Paul, and he approved us to push it again after the deadline to fix the typo and let us add this extra note.
So we have changed "javac -cp lib/junit-jupiter-api-5.0.jar */*.java" to
"javac -cp lib/junit-jupiter-api-5.0.0.jar */*.java"
===============================================================================
1. To run our application
    # Find the directory where you cloned our git repository
    # Then copy and paste the following instructions into the terminal

    cd group_0546
    cd phase2
    cd src
    javac -cp lib/junit-jupiter-api-5.0.0.jar */*.java
    java view_control.ManipulationManagerScene

2. To run unit test
    Create a intellij project in group_0546

3. Some notes for running our application
    1. "Get All Log History" -- get log histories of all image files
    2. "Add Tag", "Delete Tag", "Select Old Tag(s)", "Rename", "Move To", "Get Log History" on the bottom bar
        are for current image file
        "Show Current Directory" -- open the directory containing current image file
    3. Tag Set is on the right side
        "+" -- add tags to Tag Set
        "-" -- choose tags then click it to remove them from tag set
        "Add Tag to Image File" to add selected tags to current image file
